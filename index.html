								<p><b>LEARNIGNG OUTCOME</b><br>
									By exploring about various projects I was able to learn a lot. The following points are a few of my learning outcomes:-
									<ul type="square">
										<li>It is important to use multiple sensors as that will help me get a lot of data to train my machine learning models. This means that I need to learn more about sesnors, how to collect data from them and use them in the model.</li>
										<li>I can improve user experience of my products by increasing user interaction and giving the user more control.</li>
										<li>It doen't matter to the user how complicated the algorithm and back-end is or how much data is required to get accurate predictions. The users need an easy to use front-end and an app they can control to get their job done. Focus shouldn't only be put on improving the efficiency of the algorithm it sholud also be put on improving the users experience. Front end and back end are equally important. </li>
										
										<li>Artificial intelligence is a rising technology which has a huge place in our future and therefore people want to learn more about it. Due to this, products which help people especially children learn about the technology in a fun and easy manner are in demand. </li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>The following are 20 kickstarter projects I really liked and more about them!</p>
								<ul>
									<li><b>Project 1</b><br>
									<u>(a)Product Tiltle</u> -Newsvoice: Crowdsourced election coverage to unify the world<br>
										<u>(b)Description - </u>Newsvoice is an app which collects political news from multiole sources and shows it with different perspectives so that people are able to get views from different perspectives rather than getting biased information.<br>
										<u>(c)Impact -</u> This will help people get accurate politiical data and will help people to thik in the correct manner and not get influesnced. This can positively impact the 2020 US Elections if and enormous number of American voters use it. <br>
									<u>(d)Problem Solved -</u> People receive a lot of fake and biased news and misinformation. Newsvoice, with the help of the public, independent voters and technology can provide people with accurate news from various perspectives and perhaps save American voting from getting skewed like it had got in 2016. <br>
									</li>
									<br>
									
									
									<li><b>Project 2</b><br>
										<u>(a)Product Tiltle -DRYP - an app that keeps your plants alive & happy</u><br>

It is hard to keep track of when which type of plant will need water and what are the conditions suitable for it. Using DRYP people can keep track of when they have to water which particular plant. If your plants  are facing issues then dryp , you can enter data to the app and dryp will tell you what went wrong. It also provides a few lessons on how to keep your plant healthy.<br>
										<u>(c)Impact -</u> This will encorage people to keep more plants and will help them to take care of these plants. <br>
										<u>(d)Problem Solved -</u> Often plants become unhealthy as they are not given the amount of water they need, when they need it, etc. Many plants die this way. People can now know how to take care of which plant.<br>

								<h2 class="major">Ideation</h2>
								The follwing are a few ideas which can help and make an impcat after the COVID-19 pandemic is over and people come out of lockdown:_

								<ul><li>After lockdown ends all over the world there will be a spike in the number of people travelling as people's work is lagging. If a few people in a particular location face symptomps and have already travelled then by using previous travelling data we can see where are people from that are likely to travel(as a few more of them would have already been infected) during that time. Authorities of those areas can be notified and strict action would be taken. This would save the world from the virus hitting the second time. This can not only be used to prevent second chain of covid but can also prevent the next pandemic from taking place.</li>
								<li>In India the number of tests done each day is very small. For the Indian healthcare system testing at the capacity we need it to is not possible. By developing self-diagnostic kits for Covid(something similar to a self testing of sugar levels in blood for diabetic patients) more testing will be done. Also for getting tests done by going to hospitals there are chances that a positive patient might pass the virus to a few people. This can be eliminated by using self-testing kits. After lockdown similar testing kits should be used at airports and other such places.</li></ul>

								<h2 class="major">Ramesh Raskar's Ideation Hexagon</h2>
								<p>As a part of the curriculum for the course I got to learn a lot about Ramesh Raskar. I mainly learnt about his ideation hexagon which will help me come up with ideas to solve problems. He spoke on how we can add on to existing ideas, how we can combine two totally different types of technologies and do many more things with existing ideas so that we can come up with very effective solutions for existing problems. In his talk Mr. Raskar gave brilliant examples with the help of which I was clearly able to understand the principle of the ideation hexagon. Below is a  photo of how the ideation hexagon looks like.

								<h2 class="major">Prof. Neil Greshenfeld's Fab Labs</h2>
								<p>As a part of the curriculum for the fourth day I was required to learn about fablabs and Prof. Neil Greshenfeld. By doing this I got introduced to the concept of fab labs and how they are helping people improve various problem solving and designing skills. I got to know that these useful labs are growing at an exponential rate and that they can make a huge impact as they enable people to fabricate and create almost anything.  It gives consumers the power to produce what they consume with the help of technology.
